My name is Kevin Shi and I am a first year Data Science major at Drexel University. I am a decent coder and programmer, and I am currently using my skills to create a To-Do List website for my CI 102/103 project. One of my favorite hobbies is playing badminton, and I have worked as an assistant badminton coach at Club28 Badminton Philadelphia as previous work experience.
